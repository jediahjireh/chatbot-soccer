- **Personalised Responses**: The chatbot simulates a conversation with a Liverpool FC fan who provides insightful, sarcastic summarised answers.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Groq Cloud API
- Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive design
